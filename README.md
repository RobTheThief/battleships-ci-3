# Battleships Command Line Game

A remake of the popular pen and paper game Battleships in the command line.
Boards are printed out using keyboard characters in a matrix. It uses the
Google Sheets API to access a Google sheet and keep scores for players.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand clearly the game mechanics.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the game controls.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able keep track of score.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, see my previous scores and play again.

- ### Design
  The game is entirely command line based and so the styling is restricted to the  
  terminal it runs on.
  - #### Wireframe
    - This wireframe was used initially to get an idea how the game would look in the terminal:

  - #### Logic Flow Chart
    - This flow chart was used initially to work out the logic of the game:

## FEATURES

### EXISTING FEATURES

- **Score board**

  - Ability to add player name to keep track of score by means of a cloud based database.  
  The score board is viewed at the beginning of each game or through game commands.

  ![Score board](https://github.com/RobTheThief/battleships-ci-3/blob/main/assets/media/score_board.png)

  - The player enters their name and password.
  - Password must match if it was a previously used name.
  - A new entry is made in the Google sheets database if the name has not been used before.

  ![Google Sheets](https://github.com/RobTheThief/battleships-ci-3/blob/main/assets/media/google_sheet_sample.png)
  Sample of the google sheet used for this project

- **Choose board size and ship number** 

  - At the beginning of the game the user is prompted to enter two numbers; The size of the board and the number of ships. 

  ![Choose board size and ship number](https://github.com/RobTheThief/battleships-ci-3/blob/main/assets/media/set_size_and_ships.png)

- **Coordinate based input**

  - Using the row and column, or X, Y the player can enter the coordinates to fire upon.

  ![Coordinate input](https://github.com/RobTheThief/battleships-ci-3/blob/main/assets/media/coordinates.png)

- **Play against the computer**

  - The player plays against the computer. Unique random coordinates are generated by the program and used to
  take a shot at the players board.
  - The computers board is obscured so that you cannot see the ships.

  ![Player vs Computer](https://github.com/RobTheThief/battleships-ci-3/blob/main/assets/media/player_v_computer.png)

- **Random ship placement**

  - After the board is created random coordinates are created and used to place the correct number of ships.

- **In Game Commands**

  - After the game starts instead of entering coordinates the player can enger 4 different commands
    1. "help" is used to print out the game instructions that were printed at the beginning of the game.
    1. "scores" is used to print out the score board that was used at the begining of the game.
    1. "reset" is used to reset the game. The player is asked to confirm command first.
    1. "clear" is used to clear the visible console.
    1. "about" is used to learn more about the game mechanics if you are unfamiliar with Battleships.

### FUTURE FEATURES

- **PvP**

  - A possible future feature might be to allow player to log into a  
  lobby and match up to play against each other.

    in determining the game round number. 
1. [time:](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - time was used to create a delay between prints so that the user could see  
    the information as it was printed with `time.sleep(delay)`

    coordinates and the random placement of the ships.

## TESTING

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

  1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand clearly the game mechanics.
     1. When the game loads there are instructions on how to set up the game. 
     2. When the game loads there are instructions on how to use game commands and in  
     particular there are 'help' and 'about' commands that give an even more detailed  
     discription of how to play the game. 
     3. A legend is printed to describe the different symbols on the board.
  2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the game controls.
     1. The 'about' command will describe the how the coordinates work.
     2. The introduction information and the 'help' command describe how to enter  
     coordinates.
     3. Upon being prompted for input an example is given.
  3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able keep track of score.
     1. At the beginning of the game the top 5 best winning streaks are printed.
     2. Every time a shot is fired 'Hit' or 'Miss' is printed. 
     3. Each board has the number of hits taken displayed in each round.
     4. At the end of the game the results are recorded to the database.
     5. The user can type 'scores' at any time to see the top 5 best winning streaks  
     from past users.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1. As a Returning Visitor, see my previous scores and play again.
     1. At the beginning of the game the top 5 best winning streaks are printed.
     2. When the user logs in again their entire score history is printed.
     3. The user can type 'scores' at any time to see the top 5 best winning streaks  
     from past users.
     4. At the end of the game the results are recorded to the database.

### Known Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

- Having split the code up into modules the run_game function needed to me accessible  
in helpers but importing run into helpers caused a circular import error.
    - I was able to export the function by creating a function that takes in a function  
    as a parameter and saves it to a dictionary in the global scope of the helpers module.

#### Remaining Bugs

- No remaining bugs found

### Further Testing

- Tested locally and on the Code Institute Heroku terminal.
- Test giving the program invalid input; wrong characters, off board values, too many  
ships for board size, board size too big.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point  
out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Validator Testing

  - PEP8

    Validations errors that were found consisted mainly of 'Trailing whitespace' errors  
    and 'line too long' errors and one "comparison to True should be 'if cond is True:'
    or 'if cond:'".  

    White spaces were simply deleted. Line too long errors were solved mainly by  
    breaking up f stings and using parenthesis to enclose them, as well as editing  
    docstrings. The comparison error was solved by simply deleting '== True' as this  
    is extra or redundant.

    All three files passed the PEP8 validator tests:
    
    **run.py**
    ![Run](https://github.com/RobTheThief/battleships-ci-3/blob/main/assets/media/run_pep8.png)

    **api_calls.py**

## Deployment

- Local deployment was achieved with with Python from the console. The game was  
developed on a Ubuntu OS and so was already installed. Steps are as follows:
  - Run `python3 run.py` in the terminal with root directory of the project.

- Heroku Deployment:
    - Create a new Heroku app.
    - Set the build packs to `Python` and `NodeJS` in that order.
    - Set Config Vars key value pairs for:
      1. `PORT`: `8000`
      1. `CREDS`: `{CREDS Object}` where {CREDS Object} is from the credentials file
      dowoloaded from Google Cloud Platform.
    - Enter `heroku login -i` command in the terminal with root directory of the project.
    - Enter Heroku username and password.
    - Enter `git push --set-upstream https://git.heroku.com/battleships-ci-3.git main` to deploy.
    - Enter `git push --set-upstream https://github.com/RobTheThief/battleships-ci-3.git main` to reset upstream to github.
